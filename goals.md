We will be creating a new self this time. 

First, I will talk about the third law: We are creating a navigator, a tracker and a search-engine that searches topics from my entire notes, and then presents them, links them.
We will make sure we create it Fullstack, so it becomes presentable to the recruiter.
We have to stop wasting time on compliments, we have to really deserve them after the end of DanteMap.
We will be networking through these 16 Days in break.
