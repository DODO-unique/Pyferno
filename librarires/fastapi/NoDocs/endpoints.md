### 1. Endpoints as “departments”

* Your analogy is perfect: the client has a problem (“I want user data”), so it pings the **correct department** (endpoint `/users`).
* The endpoint receives the request (JSON, query params, whatever) and decides **how to handle it**.
* Once handled, it sends back the response—like the department returning a form or report.

---

### 2. Endpoint = decorator + function

Yes. In FastAPI, an endpoint is literally:

```python
@app.get("/users")
def get_users():
    # your logic here
    return {"users": ["Alice", "Bob"]}
```

* `@app.get("/users")` → this is the decorator that **registers the function as the handler for the GET `/users` endpoint**.
* `get_users()` → this is the function that contains **the core logic** for that endpoint.

So you were right: decorator = the “department sign,” function = “what they do when you knock.”

---

### 3. Composing your logic

* You **absolutely can** call other functions from this endpoint function.
* You can organize all your complex logic in `logic.py`, infra code in `infra.py`, helper utilities in `utils.py`, etc.
* The endpoint function acts as the “front desk,” delegating the heavy lifting to whatever you imported.

Example:

```python
# main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from logic import calculate_report
from infra import fetch_data_from_aws

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/report")
def report_endpoint(user_id: int):
    raw_data = fetch_data_from_aws(user_id)
    report = calculate_report(raw_data)
    return report
```

* Client hits `/report?user_id=123`
* `report_endpoint` runs
* Calls your **infra layer** to fetch data
* Calls your **logic layer** to process it
* Returns the final JSON

Everything is modular, and your decorators don’t care how complex the internals get—they just know: *“call this function when someone hits me.”*

---

### 4. Scaling up

* You can have **hundreds of endpoints**, each pointing to a function.
* Each function can call multiple layers: business logic, database, external APIs, helper utilities.
* The key is **decorators just register the entry point**; what happens inside is up to your Python structure.

---

So yeah: decorator = receptionist desk, function = department operations, imports = coworkers you call in for help. The client doesn’t see any of the internal calls—they just get the final response.
