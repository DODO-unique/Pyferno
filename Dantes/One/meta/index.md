# ☠️ Welcome to Hell ☠️
## Dante 1: Core Python Concepts

## Tasks:

### 🔹 Syntax, Data Types, Expressions

* Primitive types: `int`, `float`, `bool`, `str`, `complex`
* Collection types: `list`, `tuple`, `dict`, `set`, `frozenset`
* Comprehensions: list / dict / set
* Slicing, unpacking, packing (`*`, `**`, starred expressions)
* Truthy/falsy behavior

### 🔹 Variables, Scope, and Namespaces

* LEGB rule
* `global`, `nonlocal`, shadowing
* `id()`, `is`, `==`, mutability vs immutability

### 🔹 Functions & Call Mechanics

* `*args`, `**kwargs`, default params, keyword-only args
* Closures, inner functions
* `return`, `yield`, `yield from`
* Lambda, first-class functions

### 🔹 Errors & Exceptions

* `try`, `except`, `else`, `finally`
* `raise`, custom exceptions
* Exception chaining: `raise ... from ...`
* `with` and context managers (`__enter__`, `__exit__`)

### 🔹 Big-O notation and complexities

* Time/space complexity in depth
* Big-O notation in depth

### 🔹 Basic css/js

-Basic css and js for basic representation of certain projects
-Foundation for next Laws (bosses)

Victor Law: Create a utility out of this (suggestion: Try a auto complexity measurer for a code? That would be so sexy- or at least add it to TODO.md if too big)

April law: Create a python journal which reminds you of tasks from the current Dante as checkboxed, you have to add a note when you check a box.

DeadLine: 29 June (4 days because of the big A-Law)
