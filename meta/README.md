# 🔥 Pyferno: The Infernal Python Mastery Protocol

Welcome, initiate.  
This is **Pyferno** — a self-engineered hell designed to forge Python mastery through structure, suffering, and sacred law.

Inspired by Dante’s Inferno.  
Fueled by obsession.  
Signed in digital blood.

---

## 📚 What Is Pyferno?

Pyferno is a 9-Level personal mastery framework for Python.  
Each level, called a **Dante**, pushes you deeper through language concepts, real-world applications, and recursive complexity.

This isn’t a tutorial.  
This is a **fight**.

---

## 🔥 The Three Laws of Ascension

Every level enforces 3 simultaneous challenges:

### 🧪 Victor’s Law
> Build a utility using only knowledge you’ve *already* mastered.  
> No tutorials. No StackOverflow. No help.

**Test of Recall & Mastery**

---

### 🧠 April’s Law
> Build a forward-facing tool using only past-level knowledge.  
> Predict the next circle and prepare for it.

**Test of Foresight & Pattern Recognition**

---

### 🧭 The Pyfernal Law
> Expand the DanteMap — a persistent project that evolves with each Dante.  
> Part knowledge graph, part AI navigator, part chaos log.

**Test of Continuity & Vision**

---

## 🗺️ DanteMap (WIP)

The DanteMap is the central artifact of the Pyferno.  
It will eventually become:

- 🔄 A recursive knowledge graph
- 📈 A timeline of your intellectual growth
- 🧠 An intelligent REPL or CLI to query your journey
- 📖 A book or guide you can export for others

Built once. Expanded always.

## ⛓️ The Pact

> _“Extensions may not be renegotiated. Deadlines are absolute.  
> Failure to fulfill the Three Laws results in eternal banishment from the Pyferno.”_
