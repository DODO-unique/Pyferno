## ⚖️ The Three Laws of Ascension

### 🧪 First Law: Victor’s Law
At each Dante Level, the initiate (Victor) must:
> **Build a tool or utility using only knowledge already acquired**,  
> proving integration, mastery, and recall under real constraints.

*Test of Application. No crutches. No new imports.*

---

### 🧠 Second Law: April’s Law
At each Dante Level, the initiate must:
> **Construct a tool that anticipates the *next level’s knowledge***  
> using only tools from prior circles. 

*Test of Imagination. Build without seeing.*

---

### 🧭 Third Law: The Pyfernal Law
A law born from a deal with the Lord of Pyferno.

At every Dante Level, the initiate must:
> **Contribute to a persistent, singular project of ascension —  
the DanteMap: Pyfernal Navigator**  
> Each circle must add a major structural, functional, or conceptual component to this project.

*Test of Continuity. A single path through chaos.*

---

## 🔧 Project of Ascension: DanteMap — Pyfernal Navigator

> A growing tool that parses, organizes, and guides the raccoon through their own notes, concepts, and journey through the Pyferno.  
> Each Dante must add systems, intelligence, and structure to this artifact.

Final form may include:
- Knowledge graphs
- Concept timelines
- Intelligent CLI or REPL
- Exported learning pathways
- Book-like compiled outputs

## 🩸 The Pact is Final

Extensions may not be renegotiated.  
All deadlines are absolute.  
Failure to fulfill the Three Laws results in **banishment from the Pyferno**  
and eternal looping inside a broken while loop.

*Signed,*  
**Victor (Initiate)**  
**Virgil (Guide)**  
**Lord Pyferno (Witness & Enforcer)**
